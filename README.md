The IoT Kitchen System is an innovative solution that aims to enhance the safety and efficiency of kitchens, particularly in hotels and restaurants. The system uses a combination of hardware components, such as flame and gas sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, Wi-Fi and GSM modules, and an Arduino microcontroller to continuously monitor the kitchen environment and detect potential risks such as gas leaks and fires. The data collected by the sensors is organized into separate channels and exported to a real-time IoT analytics platform for storage and analysis. The platform provides a user-friendly dashboard for data analysis, enabling users to view and analyze past data to identify patterns and optimize kitchen operations. This project provides a cutting-edge solution for improving kitchen safety and efficiency.
